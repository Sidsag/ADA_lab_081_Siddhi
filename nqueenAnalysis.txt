on performing the all three approach of nqueen problem ,we get following observation :

sizeof Input    backtrack approach    optimize backtrackapproach       itterative version
4                   5 ms                      13 ms                           6 ms
8                   27 ms                     21 ms                           14 ms
10                  22 ms                     18 ms                           21
12                  30 ms                     23 ms                           212 ms
16                  42  ms                    38 ms                             --
20                  116 ms                    89 ms                             --

Note:-- for value grater than 12 ,itterative approach is taken 1000 times more than other two.
        
Conclution: Optimize backtracking is best solution for nqueen problem as it's complexity
is better than other two for n>=10. 
for n<10 itterative approach works more effciently.
Note:value of n may vary according to system and observation.
